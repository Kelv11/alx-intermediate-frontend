        <h1>The Journey of a Front-End Engineer</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            Front-end engineering is more than just creating pretty
            websites—it's about building interactive, accessible, and efficient
            user experiences. Every time you open a webpage and click a button,
            type in a form, or watch a layout adapt to your screen size, you're
            seeing the result of a front-end engineer's work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The journey typically begins with mastering the core building
            blocks: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for
            interactivity. As the web evolves, so do the tools and
            frameworks—React, Vue, Angular, and others empower developers to
            build complex applications faster and more reliably.
